# SoulSpark Quotations ðŸŒŸ
SoulSpark Quotations is a web application that allows users to anonymously share their favorite quotes and engage in meaningful discussions. This project combines a secure backend built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and a dynamic frontend created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS templating.

## Features
